Map info


Here's a [per-state choropleth map](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSsJcuJ9JFb4MYF0TZbrA4jwEdf8hzyBKJJC0queCudGMduzqQ5iOFj1iWN1EOooWEINR5DK9w8fA0r/pubchart?oid=1273408223&format=interactive) created with Google Sheets (incidentally, creating these could not be easier; see e.g. the [instructions at GeoAwesomeness](https://geoawesomeness.com/make-awesome-interactive-map-using-google-sheets-1-minute/). (Below, you have the map as an image; if you click on the link above you can get the interactive version that shows you howm many members each state has).
